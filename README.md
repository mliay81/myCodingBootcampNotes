### cd < some directory >
Change Directory - This changes the current working directory. The "working directory" is the filepath that I'm currently on, in my terminal. 

< some directory > can be any folder on your system. If it doesn't start with a /, like for example Documents/Misc, it means your current directory should have documents. 

It it's not there, it will give you this error: `-bash: cd: Documents: No such file or directory`

### Cool Shortcuts
Up key goes to the last command in your command line.

Tab key while typing a file or folder name fills out the file name if it's there. It it's there and unique.

Special directories - ~/ is your User directory; ../ is the previous, or one-up, directory. The parent directory; ./ is the current directory; just a slash is your root directory.

mv < targe file > < destination file >
Moves a file to a target destination.

You can copy a file from target to destination as well.
